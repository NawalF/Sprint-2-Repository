---Project Brief---
Our team (group 3) will be creating an organization website that will inform users of the purpose of the organization and allow users to get in contact with the organization. 
We were lucky enough to be working with the Darwin ice skating committee to create a website that will fit their purpose. 
For this sprint exercise it would be more beneficial to create a contact form that lets users send in queries to the organization instead of a registration form that do not serve much of a purpose.
